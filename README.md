# SHA3-NIST

I am still on bug bounting for the finishing touch. Algorithm is implemented, works fine, but I dind't get the expected output. This is so hard to debug but new day new luck. I used this paper for my implementation -> https://www.cryptotextbook.com/download/Understanding-Cryptography-Keccak.pdf
